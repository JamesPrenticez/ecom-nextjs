//       // Token expired
//       store.dispatch(logout()); // Clear the store or reset specific slices

// You need a mechanism to detect when the session token has expired. This can be done in several ways:

// Backend Response: Often, the backend API will return a specific response (like a 401 Unauthorized status code) when a token is expired.
// You can intercept these responses in RTK Query or in an HTTP client like Axios.

// Token Expiry Time: If your token contains an expiry time (like JWTs do), you can decode it on the client side and check if it's still valid.

// Once you've detected that the token has expired, you need to handle it appropriately:

// Redirect to Login: Redirect the user to the login page or show a login modal.
// Clear Cached Data: You might want to clear cached data that is sensitive or user-specific. 
// This can be done by dispatching a reset action for the specific RTK Query API slice or the entire store, depending on your needs.

// After the user reauthenticates, you may want to refetch user data:

// Trigger Queries Manually: You can trigger RTK Query's endpoints manually after reauthentication using the dispatch method with the initiate endpoint of your API slice.
// Use React Effect Hooks: If your components are already set up to fetch data on mount (with RTK Query hooks), simply remounting those components after reauthentication will trigger the data fetch again.

// While using redux-persist, be cautious about what data you persist. Avoid persisting sensitive data like tokens or personal information unless it's absolutely necessary and secure.

// If you're using middleware like Redux Thunk or RTK Query's baseQuery, you can integrate the token expiry logic there.
// For instance, in Axios interceptors, you can check the token expiry and dispatch relevant actions accordingly.

// If your authentication setup uses refresh tokens, you might implement a mechanism to automatically refresh the access token before it expires, thus avoiding the need for the user to manually re-login.
